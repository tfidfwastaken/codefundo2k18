## Harnessing the power of twitter users to help with disaster relief
When the Kerala Floods hit a lot of relief efforts came from an unexpected source: Twitter.
Twitter users used various tweets and hashtags to coordinate and help with relief efforts.

Our solution aims to organise and consolidate valuable information in such tweets and perform analytics to filter out how resources should be allocated and what needs to be addressed immediately.

### The parameters
We'll be using twitter's python API to parse tweets and look for important keywords that might point to relief shelters, missing persons, food and clothing.

We will also find out the category which requires the most investment in relief efforts based on the frequency of tweets with certain keywords.
