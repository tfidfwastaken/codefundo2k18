## Harnessing the power of twitter users to help with disaster relief
When the Kerala Floods hit a lot of relief efforts came from an unexpected source: Twitter.
Twitter users used various tweets and hashtags to coordinate and help with relief efforts.

### The Idea
Inspired by this, our solution aims to organise and consolidate valuable information in such tweets and perform analytics to filter out how resources should be allocated and what needs to be addressed immediately.

We will find out the most frequently mentioned places in distress and plot them on a map. We will also find the nearest relief center to those locations found in tweets.
